## Overview

Text Extracted is a web-based application designed to extract text from images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The application utilizes `pytesseract` for OCR processing and provides an intuitive interface using `Streamlit`. Additionally, the app features keyword extraction from the OCR-processed text, making it useful for data extraction, analysis, or research purposes.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images containing text.
- **Text Extraction**: The app extracts text from uploaded images using `pytesseract`.
- **Keyword Extraction**: Allows users to extract important keywords from the extracted text.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple web interface for easy interaction.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Backend**: Python
- **OCR Engine**: pytesseract (Tesseract-OCR)
- **Libraries**:
  - `streamlit`: For creating the web interface.
